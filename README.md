This project was made for an assignment in the course SWE3033 from Sunway University (BSE Hons.) programme. 

This repository was made for team members to upload their files to be compiled as increments.

The assignment entails the project members to develop an application using a Prescriptive Model, where Scrum has been selected for the purposes of this project.
The Github repository is one of the tools required to assist in documentation, so that a Descrptive Model can be made easier to document.
